  
Hey there {p}, welcome to my application named PugPawzPanel.
 
This application was made for personal use only, but I felt like it would be nice to share it only as it is a part of my work.  I am proud of it.
 
So therefore, you can now use it as well, by configuring everything righteously.  The future will behold more user-friendly ways of handling configuration.  Perhaps a completely separate GUI.
 
The bottom item menu bar contains a lot of ways of navigation.  If you click the first icon from left you will be sent to the SQL Query section.  If you press the second from left icon, you will find yourself at the downloads insertion section.  
 
The navigation is quite efficient and easy to use.  If you find any issues or have any questions, you could always send me a message at KvinneKraft@protonmail.com.
