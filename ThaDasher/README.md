# ThaDasher v1.0
### What does the cake taste like?

Well, this application was firstly meant for personal use only until I found out that it is possible to expand it far beyond what I had yet foreseen.

As it turned out, I started to integrate all kinds of functionality that it quite new to me, usually I would make separate projects out of this one big major project but this time, it is different.

Now, to get to the point, this application will allow you to stress-test the bandwidth of the network you are currently connected to but also other networks that you are able to connect to.

This stress-testing functionality comes with quite the pile of available test methods which each individually come with plenty of configurable settings.

### Currently available Methods:
Working on it.
