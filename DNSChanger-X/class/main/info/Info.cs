All you will need is access to the actual DNS server itself. This is nice because sometimes it is just better to make use of a different DNS server, for whatever reason you may come up with. To be honest, I used my own DNS changer back in school in order to bypass the network restrictions, because I wanted to play minecraft at the time but the security they used prevented any domain to be resolved.\r\n\r\n" +
		"Now though, you can actually do this quite easy, no more command line you have to learn the syntax for and no more complicated interfaces. A simplistic way to make effective changes. If you come across anything, such as bugs or whatever, then you should contact me at KvinneKraft@protonmail.com with the stack-trace (if any.) given.\r\n\r\n" +
