## A bit more about the DNS Changer-X
>Ever since the day I found out about spoofing IP addresses I had always been obsessed with spoofing my DNS.  I used to build application after application, piled onto each other all doing the same just a bit different.  Now though, I have brought to you a graphical interface based version of my original idea of the DNS spoofer.  

>I let these old type of projects go for a long time, but now I am able to see how I can improve my old ways and therefore put something out to be proud of.  My old projects were not the best, but these projects I work on today are literally based on drawings I made on paper.  No matter how complex I make the design seem on paper, I will blast it into reality.

>The entire GUI is custom and therefore unique.  It took quite a lot of effort to create all of these classes, because of all of the things I had to take into consideration.  Anyways, I hope you find it useful, you can also email me with any of your suggestions if you feel like it.
