## The Future of this Application
>I have a lot of designs laying around my room, I am just waiting for the right moment.  Right now I am tired of working on small projects that only waste my time, I want to focus on projects that are a bit more variating.  So yea, the future of this application is unclear, but if you feel like there are some things that could make this application something different, then please let me know.  You can always reach me at KvinneKraft@protonmail.com.  For now though, the project is postponed, until I feel like I want to recode this application.

## Disclaimer
>Please know I made this application for personal intentions only.  It is not meant to function within a business like environment or whatever.  It is just a little side project I enjoyed working on until I realized .NET can be a bigger pain in the @ss than C++.  Like seriously, I remember changing anything file related using C++ with just 20 lines.  File Size, Author, Version and all that type of stuff, but .NET makes it a lot harder.  Anyways, enough of me complaining.  Again, I do not think this application is actually that well made, I can do a lot better than this.  Have a nice day though!
