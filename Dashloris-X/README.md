## Information about Dashloris-X
>Hey there, even though there is a special dialog dedicated
>to the information that I want to share about this application
>within the application already, I still feel like I have to
>address a few things.

>This application was made for personal use only until I discovered
>the use others may see within its shadow.  Therefore I present to
>you the official (long postponed) Dashloris-X !

>This application will allow you to test web-servers their bandwidth using a more
>advanced version of Slowloris, going by the name of Dashloris-X.

>Dashloris-X has a lot of customization that comes with it and a lot
>of other features I have not yet seen present among other variants of
>the original Slowloris.

>Not only did I take my time to fully custom code all of the interfaces, I
>also made sure that all code is ready for update.  I both took in mind the 
>potential destined future of my application and the distinctiveness I wanted
>to be present.  

>This application is unique in its own type of way.  And all of that within
>just 2 weeks.
