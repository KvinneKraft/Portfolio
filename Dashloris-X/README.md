>~As of now my precious website is undergoing maintenance but she should be available to everyone, very soon!~  If you can not wait and still want to check the Dashloris-X release out then you can head over to the Application folder and select one of the raw versions in there or, if you are atleast as lazy as me, eh, click [Me Dashloris-X.exe](Application/1.0/Dashloris-X.exe?raw=true) for version 1.0.

## Future of Dashloris-X
>To be honest, I have a lot of designs laying around and a lot of things on my to-do list.  On a daily I am able to mark off atleast 10 things, that may seem like a lot until you realize I add about 20 new ideas to my to-do list on a daily, ahaha.  An endless circle of self satisfaction, is what I consider it to be.

>But to get to the point, the future of Dashloris-X is uncertain, just like anything else in life, but, I do have a lot of things planned for this piece of software.  The expansion it will face is far beyond my ordinary standards.  I also have plenty of other designs to work on, which means you will come across a lot on my page very soon!

## Information about Dashloris-X
>Hey there, even though there is a special dialog dedicated to the information that I want to share about this application within the application already, I still feel like I have to address a few things.  This application was made for personal use only until I discovered the use others may see within its shadow.  Therefore I present to you the official (long postponed) Dashloris-X!  

>This application will allow you to test web-servers their bandwidth using a more advanced version of Slowloris, going by the name of Dashloris-X. Dashloris-X has a lot of customization that comes with it and a lot of other features I have not yet seen present among other variants of the original Slowloris.

>Not only did I take my time to fully custom code all of the interfaces and a lot of the classes but, I also made sure all the code is ready for update whenever my Dash senses tingle.  I both took in mind the potential destined future of my application and the distinctiveness I wanted to present to the user.  

>This application is unique in its own type of way.  And all of that within just 2 weeks.  My back has severe pains now, but it is worth it, ahaha.
