## Download the The Dashloris-X
>I would recommend checking the information section first before download The Dashloris.

>You can find all (including unstable) builds [Here](https://github.com/KvinneKraft/Portfolio/tree/main/Dashloris-X/Application) on my GitHub but also [Here](https://pugpawz.com) on my website.  Please know that some versions may contain bugs, if you do find any, please reach out to me at KvinneKraft@protonmail.com about the matter, I want to squash them all and throw salt on them lil bastards (It is worth mentioning that, I would never do such a thing to a living being).

## Future of The Dashloris-X
>To be honest, I have a lot of designs laying around and a lot of things on my to-do list.  On a daily I am able to mark off atleast 10 things, that may seem like a lot until you realize I add about 20 new ideas to my to-do list on a daily, ahaha.  An endless circle of self satisfaction, is what I consider it to be.

>But to get to the point, the future of Dashloris-X is uncertain, just like anything else in life, but, I do have a lot of things planned for this piece of software.  The expansion it will face is far beyond my ordinary standards.  I also have plenty of other designs to work on, which means you will come across a lot on my page very soon!

## Information about The Dashloris-X
>Hey there, even though there is a special dialog dedicated to the information that I want to share about this application within the application already, I still feel like I have to address a few things.  This application was made for personal use only until I discovered the use others may see within its shadow.  Therefore I present to you the official (long postponed) Dashloris-X!  

>This application will allow you to test web-servers their bandwidth using a more advanced version of Slowloris, going by the name of Dashloris-X. Dashloris-X has a lot of customization that comes with it and a lot of other features I have not yet seen present among other variants of the original Slowloris.

>Not only did I take my time to fully custom code all of the interfaces and a lot of the classes but, I also made sure all the code is ready for update whenever my Dash senses tingle.  I both took in mind the potential destined future of my application and the distinctiveness I wanted to present to the user.  

>This application is unique in its own type of way.  And all of that within just 2 weeks.  My back has severe pains now, but it is worth it, ahaha.
