# Local Minecraft Server Helper:  Spigot Helper 1.0
### A tool to increase productivity by allowing you -as a developer- to update the plugins in your local /plugins folder automatically by setting up the configuration file properly.  All using a few clicks, this plugin even comes with an integrated terminal and log opener.
### The idea is quite simple, but the user-interface and functionality of this application is quite the gem, it even comes with its own configuration file!

## Downloads
> Version 1.0 can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/KvinneKraft/Software/raw/main/SpigotHelper/app/1.0/SpigotHelper.exe?raw=true).
> This version is the first version and comes with first version functionality (ironically), this functionality includes a terminal which (as of now) only allows server commands to be processed.  The next update will come with integrated commands which would allow user-interaction with the system the user is on.  Other interesting things this application has to over are the automatic configuration file loader and the auto plugin loader (with integrated plugman support).

> The terminal and other parts of this application are going to be improved (perhaps even completely recoded) in the near future, when new updates surface the new functionality does as well.
